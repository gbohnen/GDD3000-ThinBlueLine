                   <story>You’ve had a hard-knock life growing up, at least that’s what people would say to you. You found that you only agreed when referring to how many fights you’ve been in. You grew up on the streets, running around with your friends as you rough-housed with each other. Sure, the many hits to the head you’ve taken probably weren’t healthy, but they sure did build character. And by character, you mean your fists. Despite being surrounded by the more unsavoury elements of society, you’ve managed to not be swayed by their temptations, mostly due to the camaraderie found in your friends. You’ve come to the decision that your brawn would be best put to use on the force, cleaning up the streets you were raised on. Even if you have to tear down the whole mob with your fists. And you have big fists.

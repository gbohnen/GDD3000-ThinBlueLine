                     <tieronestorydescription>The air feels charged. At least that's what you and your fellow officers have been feeling for the past few months. You all had been able to place what had been causing this feeling, this foreboding sense of dread. It's only when a tip off of the street finally came in did it all come together. Ricky Veers, most know him in the department, a carreer criminal for some years now, his rise to power has been a blemish on the department for a good ammount of time. But it seems that Ricky is planning something to set himself up for life, a bank heist. Lucky for you and your own, you can finally use this to put him behind bars, at least if you catch him. Which shouldn't be a problem, you're all prepared this time... You just wish the rest of the city didn't feel like it was holding its breath...</tieronestorydescription>

                     <choiceonestorydescription>Having decided to increase your manpower around the bank, you all feel more secure in apprehending Veers and his gang. The drawback is that there is now less men to go around partrolling the city, as well as worrying the people with an increase of force.</choiceonestorydescription>

                     <choicetwostorydescription>Taking a less blunt measure, you all decide to keep your eyes on the bank, ready to deploy at any time. However, with the increase of focus on the bank itself, you know Veers is going to use this opportunity to bolster his gang with fresh numbers.</choicetwostorydescription>

                     <tiertwostorydescription>With your plans set in motion, and the city now simmering fromn your choices.

You and your fellows spend some time combing over your present evidence, ignoring your duties for a bit, to try and focus at the matter at hand.</choicetwostorydescription>

                     <tierthreestorydescription>Veers finally did it. A report comes in early one morning and you all immediately rush to arrive on the scene, it seems your earlier plans have payed off, otherwise you know yu'd never be warned in time. As you make your way there, you all begin to work on a plan of action, for once you arrive.</tierthreestorydescription>

                     <choiceonestorydescription>Veers hasn't been able to establish cover for himself and his goons yet, so you and a few others rush in to exract some hostages and take out some of Veers's men. There are casualties on both sides, and a few civallians are hit in the crossfire, but overall you find that you're successful, taking out five of Veers's gang, and saving four civalians.</choiceonestorydescription>

                     <choicetwostorydescription>It's best not to push your luck, who knows how bad things will go if you rush right in there. Instead, all four of you direct the officers on scene to cordon the bank. Veers may have more time to get what he wants, sure, but it'll be hell to get anywhere with it.</choicetwostorydescription>

                     <tierfourstorydescription>Veers knows he's in trouble, he's got no way out, so it comes to little to no surprise when he begins to threaten the lives of the civalians still inside. Time is of the essence here, and the longer you wait, the worse things'll get.</tierfourstorydescription>

                     <choiceonestorydescription>You can't risk those peoples' lives, as much as it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, you call in a negotiator. Once they arrive on the scene, Veers demands of a car and safe passage are met... At least up to a certain point. But Ricky doesn't need to know that.</choiceonestorydescription>

                     <choicetwostorydescription>You know you've got this, and there's no way you're going to let Veers squeeze his way out of this one. So you begin to open up the "negotiations," while getting your men into place. You wait for the right moment, then strike! pushing Veers and his crew back, as you secure all the hostages. It's too bad they're already making a get-away as you secure the bank. It's not like they'll get far though.</choicetwostorydescription>

It's going to take all of your skills and experience to successfully catch them, and bring them in.</tierfivestorydescription>

                     <choicefinalstorydescription>You didi it! Veers and his men weren't asble to withstand the heat you were laying down on him, eventually crashing as they tried to make their escape. Now though, they'll never be able to get away, Ricky is going to be put away for a long time, and the streets will be better for it.</choicefinalstorydescription>

                     <tieronestorydescription>The day started off fine enough, at least after you had your fill of coffee at the precinct, you felt today would be nice and quiet. And then some nutjob somehow snuck explosives into the downtown district. To be more precise, he placed them on the supports of a skyscaper... then hijacked a radio station and told the whole city. We don't have the time to go after whoever this sicko is, right now we have to deal with those bombs!</tieronestorydescription>

                     <tiertwostorydescription>As soon as the bomb was dealt with, a storm of people flooded into the downtown district, looting many of the establishments, and inciting a riot. The bomb was a diversion, to allow time for this hidden army to attack. We must act swiftly!</tiertwostorydescription>

                     <choiceonestorydescription>You rallied the remaining officers on location, and led a charge into the mob, not the most elegant of solutions, but at least you prevented the mob from gaining momentum.

                     <tierthreestorydescription>With the arrest of the rioters, you began to learn who exactly was behind all of this anarchy. An unknown man going by the name of Jon Biers, and how little anyone really knew of him. Strange, due to each of the rioters attesting that he had spoken to each and everyone of them one-on-one at some point. You know that this Jon Biers fellow isn' going to stop here, though, no. He's just run out of momentum, or maybe the riot was all a setup for another much more horrid scheme. But you have time now, and questions that need answers, but is it really worth it when you can instead prepare fo Biers's next attack?</tierthreestorydescription>

                     <choiceonestorydescription>You knew that interrogating the rioters for any bit of information on Biers would take time, and there was a chanve that nothing would come of it as well, but you had a feeling that something was off about this guy, and boy were you right. Talking to each of the rioters, you found that Biers approached each one of them individually, particualrly when they were at their lowest. He'd promise them to make things right, to lead them against the city that wronged them... now how he planned to do that, was quite varied. Where one person wanted Z, another wanted A, three more wanted Q, and a fourth of them wanted 3. Biers had promised what each and every person wanted to hear, even when their wants directly conflicted with each other, and yet he kept them all wrapped around his finger. But what was his reason for all of this? Looking at it all, the best you could surmise was that there really wasn't a reason for him, but rather the act itself. And knowing that, you probably aren't going to figure out what he's going to do next, but rather how.</choiceonestorydescription>

                     <choicetwostorydescription>You all decide that the best course of action is to get the city back under some semblance of control, to pave over the cracks that Biers had made with his stunts, and for now it's working, people are calming down and not flying off the handle, doing things that would make the situation worse. But the question is, how long will you be able to keep it that way?</choicetwostorydescription>

Apparently the coldest boss this side of the Mississippi, you don't cross him unless you expect your friends, family, and your second cousin's dog dead. What this man wants, he gets.

                     <choiceonestorydescription>It's decided that a direct attack against Sergei's forces would be the most prefferable option, depleting his men while weakening his growing power. The citizens of the city will of course be worried from the direct confrontation, but we cannot allow Rostislav's army to grow.</choiceonestorydescription>

                     <choicetwostorydescription>With the investigations you've carried out in this case, you've gathered enough evidence to strike at Sergei directly, meaning it'll be easier to call in back-up when the final showdown arrives, but putting all the evidence together will take time. Time that Rostislav will no doubt put to good use.</choicetwostorydescription>
